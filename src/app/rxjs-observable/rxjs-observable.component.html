<p>Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values</p>
<h4>Pull versus Push</h4>
<p>
  Pull and Push are two different protocols that describe how a data Producer can communicate with a data Consumer.

  What is Pull? In Pull systems, the Consumer determines when it receives data from the data Producer. The Producer
  itself is unaware of when the data will be delivered to the Consumer.

  Every JavaScript Function is a Pull system. The function is a Producer of data, and the code that calls the function
  is consuming it by "pulling" out a single return value from its call.

  ES2015 introduced generator functions and iterators (function*), another type of Pull system. Code that calls
  iterator.next() is the Consumer, "pulling" out multiple values from the iterator (the Producer).
</p>
<p>
    What is Push? In Push systems, the Producer determines when to send data to the Consumer. The Consumer is unaware of when it will receive that data.

    Promises are the most common type of Push system in JavaScript today. A Promise (the Producer) delivers a resolved value to registered callbacks (the Consumers), but unlike functions, it is the Promise which is in charge of determining precisely when that value is "pushed" to the callbacks.
    
    RxJS introduces Observables, a new Push system for JavaScript. An Observable is a Producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observers (Consumers).
    
    A Function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns a single value on invocation.
    A generator is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns zero to (potentially) infinite values on iteration.
    A Promise is a computation that may (or may not) eventually return a single value.
    An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can synchronously or asynchronously return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.
</p>

<h4>Observables as generalizations of functions</h4>
<p>Contrary to popular claims, Observables are not like EventEmitters nor are they like Promises for multiple values. Observables may act like EventEmitters in some cases, namely when they are multicasted using RxJS Subjects, but usually they don't act like EventEmitters.

Observables are like functions with zero arguments, but generalize those to allow multiple values.</p>
<i>Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function.</i>
<br/>
<i>Observables are able to deliver values either synchronously or asynchronously.</i><br/>
<i>What is the difference between an Observable and a function? Observables can "return" multiple values over time, something which functions cannot. </i>

<strong>
  <ul>
      <li>func.call() means "give me one value synchronously"</li>
      <li>observable.subscribe() means "give me any amount of values, either synchronously or asynchronously"</li>
  </ul>
</strong>

<h4>Anatomy of an Observable</h4>
<p>Observables are created using Observable.create or a creation operator, are subscribed to with an Observer, execute to deliver next / error / complete notifications to the Observer, and their execution may be disposed. These four aspects are all encoded in an Observable instance, but some of these aspects are related to other types, like Observer and Subscription.</p>

<p>Core Observable concerns:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creating Observables</li>
    <li>Subscribing to Observables</li>
    <li>Executing the Observable</li>
    <li>Disposing Observables</li>
</ol>

<h4>Creating Observables</h4>
<i>Observables can be created with create, but usually we use the so-called creation operators, like of, from, interval, etc.</i>
<h4>Subscribing to Observables</h4>
<p>
    <i>See creatingObservable method</i><br/>
    It is not a coincidence that observable.subscribe and subscribe in Observable.create
    <!-- (function subscribe(observer) {...})  -->
    have the same name. In the library, they are different, but for practical purposes you can consider them conceptually equal.
    <br>
    This shows how subscribe calls are not shared among multiple Observers of the same Observable. When calling observable.subscribe with an Observer, the function subscribe in Observable.create
    
    is run for that given Observer. Each call to observable.subscribe triggers its own independent setup for that given Observer.
    <br/>
    <i>Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing callbacks where the data will be delivered to.</i>
    <br/>
    This is drastically different to event handler APIs like addEventListener / removeEventListener. With observable.subscribe, the given Observer is not registered as a listener in the Observable. The Observable does not even maintain a list of attached Observers.
    <br/>
    A subscribe call is simply a way to start an "Observable execution" and deliver values or events to an Observer of that execution.
</p>
<h4>Executing Observables</h4>
<p>
    The code inside Observable.create
    <!-- (function subscribe(observer) {...})  -->
    represents an "Observable execution", a lazy computation that only happens for each Observer that subscribes. The execution produces multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously.
    <br/>
    There are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:
        <li>Next notification: sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.</li>
        <li>Error notification: sends a JavaScript Error or exception.</li>
        <li>Complete notification: does not send a value.</li>
    <br/>
    Next notifications are the most important and most common type: they represent actual data being delivered to an Observer. Error and Complete notifications may happen only once during the Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.
    <br/>
    <i>
        In an Observable Execution, zero to infinite Next notifications may be delivered. If either an Error or Complete notification is delivered, then nothing else can be delivered afterwards.
    </i>

</p>
<h4>Disposing Observable Executions</h4>
<p>
    Because Observable Executions may be infinite, and it's common for an Observer to want to abort execution in finite time, we need an API for canceling an execution. Since each execution is exclusive to one Observer only, once the Observer is done receiving values, it has to have a way to stop the execution, in order to avoid wasting computation power or memory resources.
    <br/>
    When observable.subscribe is called, the Observer gets attached to the newly created Observable execution. This call also returns an object, the Subscription:
  <br/>
    <i>
        When you subscribe, you get back a Subscription, which represents the ongoing execution. Just call unsubscribe() to cancel the execution.
    </i>
    <br/>
    Each Observable must define how to dispose resources of that execution when we create the Observable using create(). You can do that by returning a custom unsubscribe function from within function subscribe().
    <br/>
    For instance, this is how we clear an interval execution set with setInterval:
    <br/>
    Just like observable.subscribe resembles Observable.create
    
    <!-- (function subscribe() {...}),  -->
    
    the unsubscribe we return from subscribe is conceptually equal to subscription.unsubscribe. In fact, if we remove the ReactiveX types surrounding these concepts, we're left with rather straightforward JavaScript.
