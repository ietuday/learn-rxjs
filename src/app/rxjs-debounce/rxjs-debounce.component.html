<!-- #####signature: debounce(durationSelector: function): Observable -->
<pre>
  The gist: Throw away all emitted values that take less then the specified time (based on selector function) between output...
</pre>

<pre>
  Emits a value from the source Observable only after a particular time span determined by another Observable has passed without another source emission.
</pre>

<pre>
  It's like debounceTime, but the time span of emission silence is determined by a second Observable.
